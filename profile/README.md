# **🚀 JetTypes**

Yes, we are a github organisation. We've been in Github for 2 years! Before, we were at GitLabs. 👾

We are always accepting contributors to our projects, although we don't accept all pull requests, nor should you expect us to do so. To join us, please see [Contributing]

We're trying to build a developer community! 🚀

## ❗️ Our Standards

Before contributing, please make sure to take a look at all of the rules of each repository, following the mindset that each repository may have different rules. You may like to take a look at our **training-kit** for more details.
