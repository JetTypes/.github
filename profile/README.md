# **JetTypes**

Yes, we are a github organisation. Our goal is to make libraries, utilities, and more within the Github Community. The JetTypes project was made on 2021, although this organization was created January 9, 2026.

We're trying to build a developer community! 🚀

## Join us

We are always accepting contributors in our projects, although we don't accept all pull-requests, nor should you expect us to do so. To join us please see [Contributing]

## Our Standards

Before contributing, please make sure to take a look at all of the rules of each repository, following the mindset that each repository may have a different ruleset. You may like to take a look at our **training-kit** for more details.
