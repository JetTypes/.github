# Licenses
| Languages | Name

JetTypes uses MIT in most of its repositorys, for a free-to-use Software, to be distribuyed, commercially used.

Apart of MIT, some projects may use Apache, GPLV3, or CCU depending on the repository that is being created.

## Why MIT?

We use MIT because it gives freedom to any people that wants to do things such as **forks**, **fixes** and even see the code itself, freedom that a stricter license such as a custom one or GPLv3 doesn't provide.
